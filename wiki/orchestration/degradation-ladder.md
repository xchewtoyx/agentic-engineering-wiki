An agent system that is either fully up or fully down gives its operators, and
any agent supervising it, two choices, and both are poor during a partial
failure. Keeping full service running risks compounding damage; stopping
everything sacrifices work that could safely continue. Working out where to
land in between, in the middle of an incident, is slow and error-prone.

The pattern comes by analogy from resilience engineering. When one line of
defence is breached, a resilient system retreats to the next, lowering its
ambitions and sacrificing less-critical goals; the lines are identified
beforehand so that retreat is a chosen runbook step rather than an unplanned
collapse. Transferred to agent systems, the lines become a ladder: full
service, then a reduced tool set or cheaper model, then read-only or
answer-only, then paused with a holding message, then stopped. Work on
self-care under limited capacity adds the timing argument: demands should be
sorted green, yellow and red while headroom exists, because judging what to
drop under low capacity is itself expensive.

One software-native source supports the middle rungs. *Reliable Machine
Learning* describes switching to a simpler, bounded, non-optimal behaviour when
neither rollback nor roll-forward is available, and warns that the fallback
path must be built and exercised before it is needed. The ladder's shape and
the traffic-light classification remain analogical, so the evidence is weak.

In practice each rung needs a concrete, pre-built configuration, and each
workload (channels, scheduled jobs, individual agents) needs a droppability
class decided ahead of time. Stepping down a rung then becomes a pre-approved
action inside the agent's [autonomy
envelope](../harness/envelope-bounded-autonomy.md), usually beginning with
stopping new intake, while a [hardline command
floor](../security/hardline-command-floor.md) keeps state and secrets protected
on every rung. Rungs should be rehearsed, as [fault-injection
practice](../evaluation/practise-with-fault-injection.md) does for repairs.
Repeated descents should feed [supervision-tree
escalation](supervision-tree-escalation.md) rather than oscillate silently.
