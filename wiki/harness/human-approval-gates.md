Humans need not be fully absent from an [LLM agent](../llm-agent.md). They can
provide a high-level plan the agent expands
([hierarchical planning](../orchestration/hierarchical-planning.md)), validate a generated plan,
or execute risky steps themselves. The harness must define the automation level
allowed per action — for example, require explicit approval before a database
update, code merge, or bank transfer.

This is the agent-specific form of blast-radius control for
[write actions](agent-tool-categories.md): unreliable models should not hold
production delete keys by default. Pair gates with logging of
[function calling](function-calling.md) parameters so reviewers see what would
run before they approve — the same detail a
[tool-call transparency UI](tool-call-transparency-ui.md) surfaces to end
users. In product UIs, expose the same control as authorization prompts plus
inspectable/editable tool calls under
[agent UX steering affordances](agent-ux-steering-affordances.md).

Enforce the gate at the application layer, not the prompt layer: any tool call
with even a remote chance of being dangerous (modifying real-world assets)
must require explicit user authorization before execution via harness-level
interception, not by instructing the model to ask first — application
interception, not prompt-level pleading. Prompted requests for permission can
be skipped by the model under the same failure modes as any other
instruction; an approval step the harness enforces before dispatch cannot be.
Once given, an approval is state that must survive crashes and restarts
([durable approval state](durable-approval-state.md)).

Per-action gates sit inside two broader decisions for agents that act on live
systems. One is the default posture when nothing has been approved, which
should be read-only ([diagnose by default, act by
exception](diagnose-by-default-act-by-exception.md)). The other is which
situations the agent may handle alone at all: only those matching a prepared
runbook, with anything outside that envelope escalated as a planned step
([autonomy bounded by the prepared envelope](envelope-bounded-autonomy.md)).
Below the gates, some actions should be unavailable whatever is approved
([hardline command floor](../security/hardline-command-floor.md)).

Human involvement need not be limited to pre-execution approval. Queue human
reviewers for [workflow tasks](../orchestration/task-io-schema-design.md) whose output needs
human-level judgment the harness cannot yet automate. And when a
[Reflexion](../orchestration/reflexion.md)-based task keeps failing on the same narrow subset
of work items despite retries, that is itself a signal worth routing to a
human: have someone inspect the recurring failure case and adjust the prompt,
rather than letting the task keep burning retries against a problem retries
can't fix.
