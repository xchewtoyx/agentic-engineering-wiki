title: Diagnose by Default, Act by Exception
description: >
  An agent that operates live systems should run read-only by default and reach
  write actions only through review, a narrow deterministic action or a
  separately configured, time-bound elevated tier.

An agent with write access to a live system can make an incident worse faster
than any human. A wrong diagnosis followed by an automatic restart, config
rewrite or rollback compounds the original fault, and LLM diagnosis is often
wrong (see [LLM SRE agent success varies by benchmark and fault class](../evaluation/llm-sre-agents-low-success.md)).
[Human approval gates](human-approval-gates.md) set the automation level per
action; the prior question is what posture the agent takes when nothing has
been approved.

**Products converge on read-only.** The 2026 AI site reliability engineering
(SRE) products give the same answer. HolmesGPT is read-only by design and
respects role-based access control, with limited write actions available only
through a separate remediation integration. Azure SRE Agent offers ReadOnly,
Review (each action approved) and Autonomous modes, can run under a Reader
identity that requests temporary elevation, and always blocks `delete`,
`remove` and Key Vault commands. Datadog's Bits AI SRE runs hypothesis-driven
investigations and offers human-in-the-loop triage actions. For AWS DevOps
Agent, a third-party commentary argues that it deliberately diagnoses but does
not act, producing mitigation plans that humans execute; that framing is
opinion. A community proposal for a self-healing agent on the OpenClaw
platform, a prototype of about 500 lines, states the same rules for an agent
repairing agent infrastructure: diagnose before acting, never blind-restart,
block dangerous commands, require approval for config changes and cap
iterations.

**Diagnostic tools split detect from repair.** The same separation shows up one
level down, in the diagnostic commands an agent calls. OpenClaw's `doctor` is
built on a health-check contract in which each check implements a read-only
`detect()` returning structured findings (check ID, severity, message, fix
hint) and an optional `repair()` that runs only under `--fix`; after a repair,
detection re-runs and warns if the finding persists, so a fix is verified by
the check that raised it. Hermes's `hermes doctor` is read-only without `--fix`
and exits non-zero while problems remain, which makes it usable as a gate. The
trap is that the obvious unattended invocation is not always the read-only one:
OpenClaw's docs (as of 2026.9.x) say plain `doctor`, including
`doctor --non-interactive`, can migrate state without `--fix`, because the flag
suppresses prompts, not writes. An agent should diagnose only through postures
documented as read-only (there, `--json` or `--lint`), and treat a write
posture as an exceptional, approved action. Structured findings and exit codes
are also the cheap score that decides whether to wake an LLM at all (see
[a deterministic score gates LLM diagnosis](../orchestration/deterministic-score-gates-llm-diagnosis.md)).

**Headless coding agents make a natural diagnose tier.** The coding-agent
command-line interfaces ship different safe defaults. Cursor's `-p` mode only
proposes file changes unless `--force` is passed (its docs do not describe
sandboxing). Codex `exec` defaults to a read-only sandbox, with
`workspace-write` and `danger-full-access` as explicit escalations. Claude Code
`-p` supports `--allowedTools` rules and a `dontAsk` mode that denies anything
that would prompt. Two loading behaviours matter. Without `--bare`, Claude
Code's `-p` runs a repository's hooks and `.mcp.json` servers with no trust
dialog, and Cursor Automations warn that memories persist across runs and
advise connecting only trusted Model Context Protocol servers. Building two
tiers from these defaults is an inference, not a documented product pattern: a
diagnose tier that runs each CLI in its read-only or propose-only mode with a
narrow tool allow-list and machine-readable output, and a separate act tier
that runs bare (no repository hooks or MCP servers), under a distinct identity,
with elevation granted per action for a limited time, as Azure SRE Agent's
On-Behalf-Of elevation does. Neither tier should hold long-lived credentials
(see [credentials stay outside the sandbox](../security/credentials-outside-the-sandbox.md)),
and both sit inside the
[layered agent permission stack](../security/layered-agent-permission-stack.md).
Splitting tiers is also how such an agent drops a leg of
[the agents Rule of Two](../security/agents-rule-of-two.md): the tier that reads
[untrusted logs](../security/logs-are-untrusted-input.md) holds no write power.

When a write is warranted, it should be reached through review or a narrow,
deterministic action inside the
[prepared envelope](envelope-bounded-autonomy.md), applied by code from the
model's proposal ([the LLM proposes, code applies](llm-proposes-code-applies.md))
through a [narrow action verb](narrow-action-verb-set.md). In a durable runtime
only the read-only diagnostics should be
[marked replay-safe](replay-safe-tool-annotation.md), and any approval obtained
along the way should be [durable](durable-approval-state.md).
