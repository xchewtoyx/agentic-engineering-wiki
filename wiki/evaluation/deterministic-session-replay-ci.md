title: Deterministic Session Replay in CI
description: >
  Curated slices of recorded agent sessions become golden fixtures that CI
  replays offline, without models, tools or network, to check that a harness
  change has not silently altered the context the model is shown.

Most harness changes never touch the model. They change how history is
trimmed, which tool results are kept, how a summary is inserted or how
approvals are recorded. Each of these alters what the model is shown on its
next call, yet ordinary evaluations catch the change only indirectly, through
a shift in outcomes, and only if the evaluation happens to exercise that path.
Live evaluations are also slow, costly and noisy because the model is
non-deterministic.

Meta's Muse Code cookbook describes a cheaper check aimed at that layer.
Because every session is an append-only event log, a recorded session can be
cut down to the few events a regression needs and stored as a golden fixture,
together with the model-context projection the harness should build from those
events. In continuous integration (CI), replay rebuilds the projection from
the committed records alone, offline, with no model, tool or network calls,
and diffs it against the expectation. A merge is blocked on any diff.

The recipe's practices:

- Author fixtures by hand rather than convert raw logs wholesale.
- Review the expected projection alongside the fixture.
- Version the fixture schema, adding new versions rather than editing old
  ones.
- When behaviour changes on purpose, update the expectation in the same
  commit.

Its one sharp caveat is that the inspect command exits zero even when a
fixture has drifted, so CI must read the diff count.

The evidence is a single vendor recipe, undated and without results, so the
note is marked weak. It complements rather than replaces outcome evaluation:
replay proves the harness assembles the same context, not that the model then
behaves well. It is the deterministic, cheap end of
[in-loop regression control](../optimization/in-loop-regression-control.md),
a fast layer beneath the slower
[regression evals](capability-vs-regression-evals.md), and it depends on a
durable [session log outside the context window](../knowledge/session-log-outside-context-window.md).

An agent's own incident or task logs can double as this regression suite.
Recorded sessions, trimmed to the events that matter and with sensitive log
contents redacted, let a change to prompts, compaction or tool wiring be
checked against real work before it ships. That matters most because
[harness assumptions go stale](../harness-assumptions-go-stale.md) and get
revised often.
